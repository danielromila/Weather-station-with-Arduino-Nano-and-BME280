# Weather station with Arduino Nano and BME280 and SSD1306

I decided to make such a simple project myself, from zero. It was a good exercise for practicing with sensors and with an OLED display. I used a GY-BME/P 280, the version with 3.3 V power supply.

I also made the same project with the board TTGO Xi, a board based on the microcontroller 8F328P. I used the same code and schematics. This compatible board has different size and different order of pins. I used the dedicated SDA and SCL (that this board has, and Arduino Nano does not).
